## models for 3d printing

`shieldXL_case_v1.4.4-FDM` is probably best for home FDM printers (PLA, etc.)  

`shieldXL_case_v1.6.4-SLS-Nylon` is optimized for commercial SLS Nylon printing. (from JLCPCB, etc.)  

Use the STL file for ordering from 3D printing services or printing yourself.  

Use the STEP file if you're wanting to customize/modify the model.  

Models are setup for M2.5 screws.
