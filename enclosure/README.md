## models for 3d printing

`shieldXL_case_v1.8.6` is the most recent and is optimized for commercial SLS Nylon printing. (from JLCPCB, etc.)  This version will need supports turned on for home FDM printers.  

`shieldXL_case_v1.8.6` also includes new "lids" (top panels) which can accomodate various switch/cap combos.  

`shieldXL_case_v1.4.4-FDM` is probably the simplest model for home FDM printers (PLA, etc.). 

Use the STL file for ordering from 3D printing services or printing yourself.  

Use the STEP file if you're wanting to customize/modify the model.  

Models are setup for M2.5 screws or for M2.5 threaded heat-press inserts.
